## Reason For Making
Many people find it annoying that online manga reading comes with cons like **advetisements** (on clicking for next page, they are redirected to an ad).

It is also prefered that the manga is read in a single file view rather than multiple pages, where you have to click for the next page which disprupts the flow of manga reading.

**Have fun reading!**
